  <h1>CSS: Cascade</h1>
  <H2>CSS Cascade Level 4 Specification</H2>
  <ul>
    <li>The cascade takes an unordered list of declared values for a given property on a given element, </li>
    <li>sorts them by their declaration's precedence, </li>
    <li>and outputs a single cascaded value.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Cascade Algorithm</h2>
  <p>Here are the things the Cascade Algorithm checks, listed in order from highest weight to least weight:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Origin and Importance</li>
    <li>Specificity</li>
    <li>Order of Appearance</li>
    <li>Inheritance</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Origin and Importance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Highest weighted attribute</li>
    <li>Inculdes:
      <ul>
        <li>user agent styles</li>
        <li>browser overrides set by an individual user</li>
        <li>CSS that you, as the developer, use</li>
      </ul> 
    </li>
    <li>The importance of a CSS declaration is determined by the Important Syntax: !important</li>
    <li>Adding !important to a CSS rule automatically jumps it to the front of the cascade algorithm</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Specificity</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The more specific selector wins.</li>
    <li>A class selector is more specific than an element selector</li>
    <li>An id selector is more specific than a class selector</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Source Order</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Refers to where the style rule is coming from (i.e. user agent, external style sheet, embedded style, 
      inline style)</li>
    <li>Refers also to the order that rules are written within a single style sheet.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Example: <br>
                  h1 {color: blue;} <br>
                  h1 {color: orange;}
        </li>
        <li>These two rules could apply to the h1 element. The h1 ends up being colored orange because because both 
          rules have an identical element selector and, therefore, carry the same specificity. But, the last one in the source order wins.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Inheritance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by their child elements.</li>
  <li>For example, font color or font family can be set on parent elements and inherited by child elements.</li>
  <li>Child elements DON'T ALWAYS inherit property values from the parent.</li>
  <li>For example, if we set a width of 50% on a parent element, we wouldn't want all descendants to be 50% of that width.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Calculating Specificity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each CSS rule has a weight score based on the elements that make up the selector</li>
<li>The score is comprised of how many IDs are used, classes, and elements. And you get points respectively for each of those.</li>
<li><a href="https://polypane.app/css-specificity-calculator/" target="_blank">Specificity Calculator</a></li>
<li>ID score: 1, 0, 0 (can be read as 100)</li>
<li>class score: 0, 1, 0 (can be read as 10)</li>
<li>html element score: 0, 0, 1 (can be read as 1)</li>
<li>Combination Example: h1#sitetitle .logo: 1, 1, 1 (can be read as 111)</li>
<li>The highest specificity score wins, which make it the most specific of the bunch/li>
</ul>

<h2>The Important Rule</h2>
<h3 style="margin-left: 60px;">!important</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In CSS, you can apply the !important property to add more weight, or importance, to a property value pair than normal</li>
  <li>Example: margin-left: 0 !important</li>
  <li>We know that the below CSS code would return an h1 that is orange because the rule with orange is listed last.
    <ul>
      <li>
        h1 {color: blue;} <br>
        h1 {color: orange;}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>However, if we apply the !important property to the declaration of the first h1, the CSS code would return an h1 that is blue:
    <ul>
      <li>
        h1 {color: blue !important;} <br>
        h1 {color: orange;}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <h2>When to Use !important</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Override styles coming from code you don't control (third-party code)</li>
    <li>Generally, do everything you can to <b>avoid using !important</b>. <br>
      It's considered a bad practice because it breaks the natural cascade algorithm, making debugging much more difficult.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>!important Rules of Thumb</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Always try to solve the problem with greater specificity before resorting to !important. Make better use of the cascade by using more specific rules.</li>
    <li>Only use !important to overwrite CSS from an outside source.</li>
    <li>Completely avoid !important when writing code for other developers to use.</li>
    <li>Avoid !important on site-wide CSS.</li>
  </ul>
  

</ul>
