  <h1>CSS: Cascade</h1>
  <H2>CSS Cascade Level 4 Specification</H2>
  <ul>
    <li>The cascade takes an unordered list of declared values for a given property on a given element, </li>
    <li>sorts them by their declaration's precedence, </li>
    <li>and outputs a single cascaded value.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Cascade Algorithm</h2>
  <p>Here are the things the Cascade Algorithm checks, listed in order from highest weight to least weight:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Origin and Importance</li>
    <li>Specificity</li>
    <li>Order of Appearance</li>
    <li>Inheritance</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Origin and Importance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Highest weighted attribute</li>
    <li>Inculdes:
      <ul>
        <li>user agent styles</li>
        <li>browser overrides set by an individual user</li>
        <li>CSS that you, as the developer, use</li>
      </ul> 
    </li>
    <li>The importance of a CSS declaration is determined by the Important Syntax: !important</li>
    <li>Adding !important to a CSS rule automatically jumps it to the front of the cascade algorithm</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Specificity</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The more specific selector wins.</li>
    <li>A class selector is more specific than an element selector</li>
    <li>An id selector is more specific than a class selector</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Source Order</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Refers to where the style rule is coming from (i.e. user agent, external style sheet, embedded style, 
      inline style)</li>
    <li>Refers also to the order that rules are written within a single style sheet.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Example: <br>
                  h1 {color: blue;} <br>
                  h1 {color: orange;}
        </li>
        <li>These two rules could apply to the h1 element. The h1 ends up being colored orange because because both 
          rules have an identical element selector and, therefore, carry the same specificity. But, the last one in the source order wins.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Inheritance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by their child elements.</li>
  <li>For example, font color or font family can be set on parent elements and inherited by child elements.</li>
  <li>Child elements DON'T ALWAYS inherit property values from the parent.</li>
  <li>For example, if we set a width of 50% on a parent element, we wouldn't want all descendants to be 50% of that width.</li>
</ul>
