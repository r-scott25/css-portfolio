  <h1>CSS Box Model</h1>
  <p>Every single element on your webpage is considered to be in a box: images, text, forms, everything.</p>
  <h2>Properties of Each Box</h2>
  <p>Properties relate to the size of the element AND how it relates to the elements around it.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Width</li>
    <li>Height</li>
    <li>Border</li>
    <li>Margin</li>
    <li>Padding</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Content/Elements Edge/ Width & Height</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you don't specify a width or a height, then that's determined automatically based on how much space the content takes up.</li>
    <li>You could also just specify the width and the height would be calculated automatically.</li>
  <li>Example: The element is set to 100 pixels. By default, in the CSS Box Model, the box-sizing property is set to conent box. That means that if you set an element to 100 pixels, then just the conent box equals that 100 pixels. Any borders or padding would be added on top of that.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Padding</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The space added to an element outside the element's edge.</li>
    <li>Padding is clear space</li>
    <li>You can define padding individually for the top, right, bottom, or left sides of an element.</li>
    <li>When you add padding, you increase the size of the box, accordingly.</li>
    <li>A box that has a content width of 100px, and padding of 20px on all sides would give us a total of 140 pixels of total width.</li>
    <li>To change that behavior, you could change the box-sizing property to a border box, which tells the browser to account for any border and padding in the overall width that you specify for an element. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Border</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Wraps around the padding</li>
    <li>Factors into the overall width of the element (like padding does)</li>
    <li>Border is visible and can have color and thickness applied to it</li>
    <li>Can be applied specifically from top to bottom or right to left</li>
    <li>Can be styled as solid, dotted, dashed, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Margin</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Represents the space outside the border</li>
    <li>Used to define the space between elements on a page</li>
    <li>Can be specified for each side of the element: top, right, bottom, left</li>
    <li>Does not factor into the overall width of the element</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Box Model Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If a property is not declared, you cannot assume the value is 0</li>
    <li>Elements often have default margins you need to account for - if you don't override them, the default value will be applied</li>
    <li>A 100% width property, when combined with padding and vorders, can create elements that are larger than their parents</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Normal Flow/Flow Layout</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The default way elements are displayed on a page according to the HTML DOM</li>
  </ul>
