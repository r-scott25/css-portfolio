  <h1>Layouts</h1>
  <h1>Structuring a Page with CSS</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>A browser reads an HTML document from the top down.</li>
    <li>If there's no CSS intervention, that HTML will appear on the page as a bunch of stacked elements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>HTML Page Layouts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Tables</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Before CSS, people just used tables to create row and column-based layouts. This was terrible as that's not really what HTML table markup was meant for and it left us with a mess of unsemantic HTML, inaccessible layours, and code taht was very difficult to maintain.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>CSS Floats, positioning, and clears</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Not <i>really</i> a layout system, but it did give us the ability to manipulate where elements appeared on a page relative to their neighboring elements. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>CSS frameworks and grids</b>
    <ul>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Carrie's calling all of these HTML layouts because they primarily rely on the actual structure of the HTML document to put content where you'd want it on the page.</li>
  <li><b>Flexbox</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Commonly Used Today</li>
    <li>A one-dimensional flexible box module that lets us distribute content evenly and flexibly to fill all the available space.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>CSS Grid</b>
  <ul>
    <li>First true two-dimensional layout tool in CSS that lets us treat the viewport like a canvas.</li>
    <li>Radically changes how we design page layouts for the web.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout Module)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A layout module for CSS that gives you an efficient way to arrange, organize, and size website elements 
        to create responsive designs.
      </li>
        <li>
          Lets us arrange items within a parent container and then get specific about how we want those items 
            to behave in relationship to one another.
          </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Flexbox</h2>
  <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">*CSS-Tricks: A complete Guide to Flexbox</a>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Flex container (parent)</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &lt; section class="container &gt; <br>
          &lt; /section &gt;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Flex items (children) (elements within the parent container)</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &lt; section class="container &gt; <br>
          &lt; /div &gt; <br>
          &lt; /div &gt; <br>
          &lt; /div &gt; <br>
          &lt; /section &gt;
        </li>
        <li>The flex items are placed along flex lines, which are either a vertical or horizontal axis.</li>
        <li>These items can be manipulated in layout, size, spaceing, and even change order along the flex line. <br>
            *** You can manipulate the order of flex children without touching the HTML structure.</li>
        <li>This allows you to take advantage of the available view port space and lets elements <br>
            arrange themselves automatically as the view port dictates.</li>
        <li>Alignment</li>
        <li>Direction</li>
        <li>Order</li>
        <li>Size</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Flexbox is a one dimensional presentation model. This means that layouts are processed in one dimension 
        at a time, either as a row or a column.</li>
    <li>You can define how space is distributed between elements and how they should be aligned in relationship to the parent container.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Flexbox Benefits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Responsive (mobile-friendly)</li>
    <li>Ease of positioning child elements</li>
    <li>Change presentation order without altering HTML</li>
    <li>Control width and height based on parent element</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Flexbox generally works best on small scale layouts.</h3>

  <h2>CSS Grid</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      .container { display: grid; }
    </li>
    <li>The most powerful way to control page layouts</li>
    <li>A two-dimensional layout system. This allows developers to place HTML elements in a Grid-based layout using both rows and columns simultaneously.</li>
    <li>With Grid, we can apply a grid to a container and then put content wherever we want within that grid - Completely independent of semantic HTML markup.</li>
    <li>Equivalent of a print-based grid layout with the flexibility of responsive design.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>CSS Grid Concepts and Terminology</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      .container { display: grid; }
    </li>
    <li>A grid is an element with its display properties set to grid.</li>
    <li>Grids have rows, and those are horizontal lines, and columns, which are vertical lines.</li>
    <li>Grid Lines are the lines that make up the grid and they can be horizontal or vertical.</li>
    <li>A Grid Track is the space between two grid lines. Grid tracks can also be horizontal or vertical, 
        representing rows or columns.</li>
    <li>A Grid Cell is the space between four Grid Lines.</li>
    <li>A Grid Area is any area within the grid defined by its four outer most grid lines. 
        A Grid Area can cover multiple lines and contain multiple cells.</li>
    <li>You define a grid, and you either allow items to be automatically placed into cells defined by that Grid, 
        or control their positioning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>CSS Framework (or Library)</h2>
  <h3>Collection of style sheets that provide layout and styling for common design elements</h3>
  <p>A CSS framework is a collection of CSS files with predefined rules for commonly used things like typography, UI components, layouts, and browser resets.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Typography</li>
    <li>Buttons, forms, controls</li>
    <li>Grids/layouts</li>
    <li>Resets</li>
  </ul>
 
  <h2>Benefits of Using a CSS Framework</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Achieving cross-browser compatibility</li>
    <li>Consistent styling</li>
    <li>Creating responsive layouts</li>
    <li>Speeding up your development time</li>
    <li>Learning CSS by studying other people's code</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Popular CSS Frameworks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Foundation</li>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Tailwind</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
  <h3>An approach to web design used to create layouts that respond to the device used to view the content</h3>
  <h3>CSS Gives Us Multiple Ways to Achieve This:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Media Queries</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Can be used to check many things:</li>
      <li>Width and height of a viewport</li>
      <li>Width and height of the device</li>
      <li>Orientation (portrait/landscape</li>
      <li>Resolution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Flexbox and Grid</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Responsive by default</li>
    <li>In Flexbox, flex items will shrink and distribute space between the items according to the space available 
        in their parent container. You can specify values to indicate how you want those items to behave when there's 
        either more space or less space around them.</li>
    <li>CSS Grid allows the distribution of available space in a container across grid tracks. So, grid responds natively to whatever the container size is.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Typography Responses</b>
<ul>
  <li>Using media queries, we can also make typography responsive</li>
  <li>For example, if we have a base font size of 20px, we can then scale that up or down using rem units.
    <ul>
      <li>
        html { font-size; 20px; } <br>
        h1 { font-size 2rem; } <br>
        @media (min-width: 1200px) { h1 { font-size: 4rem;} }
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Alternatively, you can use the view port width to dynamially calculate font size
    <ul>
      <li>
        &lt;meta name="viewport" <br>
        content="width=devide-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</li>
  </ul>
